# Assignment_1:

## Exercise 1:
Building a Neural Network from scratch → just math and Numpy.\
Simple 2-layer NN and its training algorithm based on **back-propagation** and **stochastic gradient descent**

Benchmark to test the model → image classification task using `CIFAR-10 dataset`

Starting Hyper-parameters:\
&emsp; {'learning rate': 0.0001, 'regularization': 0.25, 'numer of epochs': 1000, 'batch_size': 200}\
Validation Accuracy: 0.287
