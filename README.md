## Assignment_2: 
Implementation of a **Convolutional Neural Network** (CNN) for image classification on the `CIFAR-10 dataset` using Pytorch.

The model processes 32x32 color images and consists of five hidden layers with filter sizes: [128, 512, 512, 512, 512]
The network architecture consists of five convolutional blocks, each comprising Convolution, BatchNormalization, pooling, ReLU and Dropout operations.

A fully connected layer is used for 10-class classification.

Techniques of geometric and color space **data-augmentations** to improve generalization.
